# Space Shooter Game

Vibe till we die homies.
First Project 

Full speed ahead towards the Singularity!


## Development & AI Guidelines

This project uses an explicit engineering doctrine to ensure:
- stable 60fps performance on real devices
- allocation-free hot paths
- predictable architecture for future features

Before making any code changes (human or AI-assisted), please read:

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — project goals, constraints, and feature scope
- `docs/AI_DEV_PLAYBOOK.md` — workflow and performance rules
- `docs/HOT_PATHS.md` — performance-critical code paths

These documents are authoritative.
